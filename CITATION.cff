  This novel emotional mnemonic discrimination task is
  designed to assess memory specificity and pattern
  separation for emotionally salient and neutral stimuli.
  The task has two parallel subsets: Subset A and Subset B
  Both sets have been thoroughly balanced, piloted, and
  matched for difficulty. Each subset includes trials
  assessing participantsâ€™ ability to distinguish between
  targets, lures, and foils across varying emotional
  valences. Because Subsets A and B are equivalently
  challenging and psychometrically matched, this task is
  ideal for intervention studies or within-subjects/repeated
  measures designs, as the alternate forms can help minimize
  learning effects and reduce interference from prior
  exposures. Each subset is designed to produce memory
  performance patterns consistent with those observed in the
  original Emotional Mnemonic Discrimination Task.
